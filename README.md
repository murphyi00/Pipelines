# Stock Correlation Analysis with PySpark, Minio, and Neo4j
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform a stock correlation analysis using PySpark, Minio, Neo4j, and yfinance. The primary objectives are to:

Fetch stock data for a list of tickers using yfinance.
Store the data in a Minio object storage bucket.
Process and analyze the data using PySpark to compute correlation matrices.
Save and visualize relationships in a Neo4j graph database.
Perform additional analysis by identifying strongly correlated stocks and updating the Neo4j database accordingly.
# Technologies and Libraries Used
Python
PySpark: Distributed data processing.
Minio: Object storage compatible with Amazon S3.
Neo4j: Graph database for storing and querying relationships.
yfinance: Python library to download market data from Yahoo Finance.
Py2neo: Python client library and toolkit for working with Neo4j.
Spark MLlib: Machine learning library in Spark for statistical analysis.
Project Components
Data Acquisition:

Fetch stock data for a list of tickers using yfinance.
Tickers include major companies and ETFs like AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, SPY, QQQ, etc.
# Data Storage:

Initialize a Minio client and create a bucket if it doesn't exist.
Save the stock data as CSV files in the Minio bucket.
Data Processing:

Initialize a Spark session with Minio and Neo4j configurations.
Load the stock data from Minio into a Spark DataFrame.
Perform data transformations and compute the correlation matrix using Spark MLlib.
Correlation Analysis:

Extract and filter correlations based on a specified threshold (e.g., 0.5).
Save the filtered correlations to the Neo4j graph database.
Identify strongly correlated stocks (e.g., correlation > 0.8) and update Neo4j.
# Visualization and Further Analysis:

Use Cypher queries to read data from Neo4j.
Analyze and visualize the relationships between stocks.
Save results back to Minio if necessary.
# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
PySpark
Minio Server
Neo4j Server
Required Python Libraries:
yfinance
minio
py2neo
neo4j
Spark Neo4j Connector:
neo4j-connector-apache-spark_2.12-4.1.0_for_spark_3.jar
Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/murphyi00/pipelines.git
cd pipelines
2. Install Required Python Libraries
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

pip install yfinance minio py2neo neo4j
3. Set Up Minio
Install Minio Server if not already installed.

Configure Minio with the following credentials (used in the script):

Access Key: minio
Secret Key: **********
Bucket Name: minio-project
Start the Minio Server:

bash
Copy code
minio server /path/to/your/data
4. Set Up Neo4j
Install Neo4j Server if not already installed.

Configure Neo4j with the following credentials:

URL: neo4j://neo4j:7687
Username: neo4j
Password: **********
Start the Neo4j Server and ensure it's running.

5. Configure Spark
Ensure Spark is installed and properly configured.

Copy the Neo4j Connector JAR to Spark's JAR directory:

sudo cp /path/to/neo4j-connector-apache-spark_2.12-4.1.0_for_spark_3.jar /usr/local/spark/jars/
Update Spark Configuration in your script or spark-defaults.conf if necessary.

How to Run the Project
Execute the Script

Run the Python script:

python stock_correlation_analysis.py
Script Breakdown

Initialize Minio Client:
Checks if the bucket exists; if not, creates it.
Initialize Spark Session:
Configures Spark to interact with Minio and Neo4j.
Download Stock Data:
Uses yfinance to fetch historical stock data.
Stocks are listed in the tickers array.
Process Data with Spark:
Converts data into a Spark DataFrame.
Performs correlation analysis on closing prices.
Compute Correlation Matrix:
Uses Spark MLlib to compute the correlation matrix efficiently.
Filter and Save Correlations:
Filters correlations based on a threshold.
Saves the results to Neo4j and Minio.
Update Neo4j with Strong Correlations:
Identifies strongly correlated stocks.
Updates Neo4j with new relationship types.

Configuration Files:
Spark and Neo4j configuration settings are embedded within the script.
 Functions and Components
# Data Acquisition
yfinance:
Fetches historical stock data starting from a specified date.
Handles multiple tickers simultaneously.
Data Storage
Minio Client:
Provides an S3-compatible object storage solution.
Stores the processed CSV data files.
# Data Processing
Spark DataFrame Operations:

Efficiently handles large datasets.
Converts data into vectors for correlation computation.
Spark MLlib Correlation:

Computes the Pearson correlation matrix.
Optimized for performance, avoiding bottlenecks.
Graph Database Integration
Neo4j and Py2neo:
Stores stocks as nodes and correlations as relationships.
Allows for complex queries and visualization of stock relationships.
Performance Optimizations
Batch Operations:
Nodes and relationships are created in batches to improve performance.
Reduces the overhead of multiple database transactions.
### Results and Visualization
Correlation Analysis:

Identifies pairs of stocks with significant positive or negative correlations.
Helps in portfolio diversification and risk management.
Neo4j Graph:

Visual representation of stock correlations.
Enables interactive exploration of relationships.
Future Improvements
Expand Dataset:

Include more stocks or financial instruments.
Fetch data over a longer time horizon.
Advanced Analytics:

Implement additional statistical measures like Granger causality.
Use machine learning models for predictive analysis.
User Interface:

Develop a dashboard using Neo4j Bloom or a custom web app.
Allow users to interact with the data and visualizations.
Automate Data Updates:

Schedule regular data fetches and analysis.
Keep the Neo4j database updated with the latest correlations.
Troubleshooting
Minio Connection Issues:

Ensure Minio server is running and accessible.
Verify access s and endpoint URLs.
Neo4j Connection Issues:

Confirm Neo4j server is running.
Check authentication credentials.
Spark Configuration Errors:

Ensure all JAR files are correctly placed.
Verify Spark configurations, especially for external data sources.
